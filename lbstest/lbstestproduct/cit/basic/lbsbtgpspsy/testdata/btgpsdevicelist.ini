// BT GPS Device List
// ------------------
// Contains a list of all the Simulated BT GPS devices available.  Each device can only be added/created once in the test, so there are
//  some identical devices which just have different addresses, which allows multiple devices to be used in the test.
// - For more information about the use of the of the entries, look in: ctlbsgpsdevicelisthandlerbase.cpp

// ---------------
//INI File Details (for more information see the ctlbsgpsdevicelisthandlerbase.cpp file)
// ---------------

//Name - Descriptive name of the BT GPS device.  This is used for logging purposes.
//Address - The address of the BT GPS device (TBTDevAddr) - This is a made up address, but follows the standard:
	// [ 000 4letters 4numbers].  The 4 letters are unique to the device type, the numbers increment to show different devices of the same type
//Port - The port/SDP Channel of the BT GPS device
//Type - The type of the BT GPS device. For a list of possible types and what they mean, look in the file btgpssimtypes.h
//File - Location of the file to get the NMEA strings out of (Simulation Devices Only)
