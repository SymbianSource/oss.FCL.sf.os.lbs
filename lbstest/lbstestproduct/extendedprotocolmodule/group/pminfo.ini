// This ini file contains a list of all the different extended hybrid Protocol modules.
//  Each section contains the UID for the PM and the RProperty Key values that should
//  be used by the GetAFixUtils.  Since multiple PM's can be loaded at the same time the
//  GetAFixUtils pipe (used for communicating between the test and the PM) needs to be unique
//  for each PM.  Both the NetProtocol Proxy and the PM Stub code use this ini file to match
//  

// This ini file is owned (i.e. Built) by the stub extended hybrid PM code, and is used by:
//  - Stub PM Code (Used to identify RProperty Key Values)
//  - Net Protocol Proxy Code (Used to identify RProperty Key Values)
//  - The Hybrid Multiple test code (Used to specify which PM should be used)

// NOTE: To help simplify the searching in the stub PM code, the PM UID is listed twice.  The
//  first entry (UID = ) is used by the test code.  The second entry (which puts the PM UID on 
//  the lhs) is used by the PM Stub code to identify which section to use for the key values.
//  Listing the UID like this helps reduce the complexity of the code in the PM stub.
//  So when adding a new PM, ensure both UID entries are added.  (If the PM testdata id is 1 
//  (i.e. [PM1]), then the second entry should be (uidvalue = 1).  The UID value on the lhs
//  should also be all in lower case.
