#positioning capabilities of an AGPS Integration Module intended to be used as a bitmask.
#
#Currently only the following combinations are supported:
#  - EDeviceGpsModeTerminalBased
#  - EDeviceGpsModeTerminalAssisted
#  - EDeviceGpsModeTerminalBased | EDeviceGpsModeTerminalAssisted
#  - EDeviceGpsModeSimultaneousTATB
#
#Specifying a bitmask with more than one mode enabled means that all the modes are supported, but not simultaneously. 
#For example “EDeviceGpsModeTerminalBased | EDeviceGpsModeTerminalAssisted” means that a module can support both, 
#Terminal Assisted and Terminal Based positioning, but only one at a time.
#                                                                                                
#No capabilities. Also used to initialise variables:

#Device supports Terminal Based positioning and is also able to
#calculate position autonomously if assistance data is unavailable,
#or does not arrive on time (e.g. a fix is obtained before assistance data

#Device supports Terminal Assisted positioning.
#The module may, but does not have to be able to calculate position autonomously
#if Terminal Assisted positioning does not succeed (e.g. network is unavailable):

#Device can perform Terminal Assisted and Terminal Based positioning at the same time. 
#It is also able to calculate position autonomously if assistance data is unavailable (e.g. network error), 
#or does not arrive on time (e.g. a fix is obtained before assistance data delivery). 
#NOTE: If you set this bit then it is not necessary to set either of the previous 2 bits as they are implied:
